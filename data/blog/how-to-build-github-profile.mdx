How to Create an Amazing Github Readme Profile

# Introduction

Hello Tech Geeks üëãüèª, Welcome to the first article of this series where I'm going to share my git & github learning and best resources as well as practices for developers. In today's tech world, Github is a portfolio for developers. Everything you can mention on github your profile such as projects, collaboration projects, development statistics, and many more.

As a developer, you have to know how about the version control system. Git is the current choice of many developers as a VCS. We'll learn more about Git & GitHub in an upcoming article now we are going to learn how to optimize a github profile in the best way?

In this article, I will be sharing the finest resources and courses to make your github profile stand out from the crowd. This contains everything you need to optimize your github profile as a beginner. So, Let's get started!

# Let's Begin

To optimize your GitHub profile you have to create a github repository with your **github username.**

![Create repo with github username.](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1673286559941/9df6c682-5944-4087-9952-eadb9e3e94c3.png align="center")

- Create a repo with a github username.
- It's a ‚ú®*special* ‚ú® repository that you can use to add [`README.md`](http://README.md) to your GitHub profile. Make sure it‚Äôs public and initialize it with a **README** to get started.
- Add the license to it.

That's it.

Now you created a repo with a github username and it will appear on your profile as a readme.MD file. The MD file extension stands for markdown similar to HTML.

# GitHub Readme Generators

Now your GitHub readme file is completely empty and we are going to create a profile. The generators help you to create an awesome github profile but due to generators' optimization, you have some limitations.

But as a beginner, you will able to create a standard profile with online generators. Here is the list that contains readme generators for you to create a profile.
