# Introduction

Technical writing is a highly demanding skill in the market right now because every organization needs someone to <mark>break complex terms into simple words</mark> to explain the product to the user. Not only the product but all technical terms and new product features to the user.

Nowadays technical writers closely work with the engineering team of the product to understand the technical aspects of the product. Very few writers sustain themselves in the field of tech writing because here you have focused more on technical terms and **<mark>content should be user-oriented.</mark>**

> Technical writing focused more on technical terms and content should be user orienetd to understand. üë®üèª‚Äçüè´

Technical writing involves development, creation and etc. things and as a tech writer, you have to manage multiple things that's why many people failed in their technical writing careers. To become the best at technical writing you have to read more, write more, and understand very well what a product or service is.

You have to be good at product understanding, and writing and always think about the end user side before delivering a piece of content to the community because it's highly essential in terms of tech writing.

# Why Technical Writing?

It's completely my take on technical writing because I am writing technical content for more than a year now. Every person no matter whether you're a developer or not you should know a basic understanding of writing.

The developer should know how to write technical terms and product guides, tutorials at least the basics of writing are essential for everyone. Writing helps a lot as an individual developer you can share your journey by writing blogs & articles to show to others.

> Technical writing is a continuous process of learning, carefully gathering, sifting, organizing, and assessing, all while trying to craft something that makes sense for a user.

Recently, I started my youtube channel and shared why you should start with technical writing and answered basic questions regarding tech writing.
