# Social Setup for Content Creators 👨🏻‍🏫

1. First things first **don't pick random things pick only necessary things** and platforms if you're going to create text-based content or blogging pick only one platform don't write on every platform.

2. One name for all socials rule it's easy for people to know the person if a person has the same username on every social platform. Pick only one unique name.

3. Profile picture should sound professional or looks great and matches with content you share so having well profile picture matters a lot.

4. Bio is more important limited words and needs to be kept short and more informative which describes your work if you are a writer then mention something like **Tech Writer or Creative Writer** sharing knowledge with writing articles or something like that. It helps people to understand your content better.

5. Community Engagement is also there, Try to find out active communities which support the type of content you creates, some communities are available on discord and some of them have a slack channel just search a little bit you will get the communities.
